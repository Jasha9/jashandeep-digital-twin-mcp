I\u0027m Jashandeep, and I\u0027m in my final year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at Victoria University in Brisbane. What really excites me about tech is turning ideas into working solutions that help people.\n\nOver the past year, I\u0027ve been fortunate to complete two remote internships with ausbiz Consulting. The first was a 10-week Full Stack Developer program where I built and deployed applications using React 19, Next.js 15, and AWS. I learned everything from building type-safe APIs to deploying applications on Vercel.\n\nCurrently, I\u0027m in my second internship as an AI Builder, where I\u0027m developing enterprise-grade digital twin implementations and RAG systems. One project I\u0027m really proud of is my Food RAG Explorer - an AI application that provides intelligent information about 105 different foods. I migrated it from a local setup with Ollama and ChromaDB to a production environment using Grok API and Upstash, and deployed it on Vercel.\n\nOutside of technical work, I\u0027m also a Student Tutor and Mentor at Victoria University, where I\u0027ve supported over 100 students in navigating university life - helping them with everything from understanding the LMS to developing study strategies. This has really strengthened my communication skills and taught me how to explain complex concepts in simple terms.\n\nI\u0027m graduating in June 2026 and I\u0027m looking for opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects, continue learning, and grow as a developer."

Initially, I had it running locally with Ollama and ChromaDB, which worked fine on my machine, but I realized if I wanted this to be a real product that others could use, I needed to deploy it to the cloud.\n\nThe challenge was that I had never migrated an AI application from local to production before. I had to learn about vector databases in the cloud, figure out API integrations, and understand how RAG systems actually work at a deeper level.\n\nSo I broke it down into steps. First, I researched cloud alternatives - I migrated from Ollama to Grok API for the AI inference, and from ChromaDB to Upstash for vector storage. Then I used V0.dev to design a clean web interface, and deployed everything to Vercel. Along the way, I had to set up MCP servers for model communication and ensure the vector embeddings were working correctly.\n\nThe result? I successfully deployed a working AI application that\u0027s now live on Vercel. But more importantly, I gained a deep understanding of how RAG systems work, how vector embeddings improve AI response accuracy, and the entire deployment pipeline from local development to production. It taught me that complex problems become manageable when you break them into smaller pieces and tackle them systematically."

This actually happened during my Full Stack Developer internship with ausbiz Consulting, which was a 10-week intensive program.\n\nThe situation was that I had some basic coding knowledge from university, but I hadn\u0027t worked with modern production frameworks like React 19, Next.js 15, or cloud deployment before. The program was fast-paced, and we were expected to build and deploy real applications within those 10 weeks.\n\nWhat I did was adopt a very hands-on learning approach. I\u0027d watch the training materials, but then immediately apply what I learned by building small features. I also made heavy use of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT - not just to write code, but to understand *why* the code worked that way. When I got stuck, I\u0027d ask specific questions rather than broad ones.\n\nFor example, when learning about server-side rendering in Next.js, I didn\u0027t just read about it - I built a small feature that required SSR, broke it, and fixed it. That\u0027s how the concepts really stuck.\n\nBy the end of those 10 weeks, I had built multiple full-stack applications with React 19 and Next.js 15, integrated PostgreSQL databases with Prisma ORM, worked with AWS cloud services, and deployed production-ready applications to Vercel. I also earned my Full Stack Developer certification.\n\nThis experience taught me that I thrive in intensive learning environments, and that I\u0027m capable of picking up new technologies quickly when I combine structured learning with hands-on practice."

Right now, I\u0027m managing my AI Builder internship, working as a Student Tutor and Mentor at Victoria University, working part-time as a Front Office Receptionist at Royal Albert Hotel, and completing my final year of studies. It definitely keeps me busy!\n\nThe key is that these roles actually fit together quite naturally because of how they\u0027re structured.\n\nMy mentoring role is most demanding during new student intakes - orientation periods at the start of semester. But here\u0027s the thing - those periods usually coincide with my university vacation breaks. During those times, I\u0027m authorized to work full-time on my student visa, so I can dedicate more hours to supporting the 100+ students who need help navigating the LMS, university apps, and getting settled in. When classes are in session, the mentoring role is much lighter.\n\nMy tutoring work is request-based, which gives me flexibility. If a student requests help, I prioritise that and schedule it around my other commitments. I also run support sessions for students outside of their regular lecture times, which I can plan ahead - usually during evenings or between my other responsibilities. This way, students get the help they need when they\u0027re actually stuck on problems, and I can manage my schedule effectively.\n\nMy receptionist job is part-time evening shifts, which works perfectly because it doesn\u0027t conflict with my day-time university schedule or the tutoring sessions.\n\nAnd my internship is remote, which is brilliant because I can work on it during the day when I have blocks of free time, and I don\u0027t lose time commuting.\n\nMy approach is built on three things: strategic scheduling, clear communication, and prioritization. I map out my week at the start, communicate proactively with all my supervisors, and prioritize based on deadlines and impact.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve learned is that it\u0027s not just about being busy - it\u0027s about being intentional with your time. Managing all these responsibilities has made me really efficient, and each role actually complements the others. Tutoring has made me better at explaining technical concepts, my hotel job has strengthened my customer service skills, and the internships give me real-world experience to share with students."

As a mentor, I help students with the practical side of university life - navigating the LMS, understanding which apps to use, figuring out how to access resources, basically everything that can feel overwhelming in those first few weeks. I remember when I was a new student, everything felt confusing, so I try to make that transition smoother for others.\n\nAs a tutor, I work with students on understanding course concepts, and this is request-based - when a student reaches out for help, I prioritise their request and schedule a session. What I\u0027ve learned is that everyone learns differently. Some students need visual explanations, others need to work through examples, and some just need someone to break down complex ideas into smaller chunks.\n\nI also run support sessions outside of regular lecture times - these are extra sessions where students can come with their problems and work through them together. I might schedule these in the evenings or between my other commitments, and it creates a space where students feel comfortable asking questions without the pressure of a formal class setting.\n\nOne thing I\u0027m particularly proud of is that I don\u0027t just help students solve immediate problems - I teach them how to approach problems. For example, if a student is struggling with a coding assignment, I\u0027ll walk them through my debugging process, show them how to break down the problem, and give them frameworks they can use next time.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve gained from this experience goes beyond just helping others. It\u0027s taught me patience, improved my communication skills dramatically, and honestly, teaching concepts has deepened my own understanding. When you can explain something clearly to someone else, you really know it yourself."

I had a student who was struggling with our university's LMS system. She kept saying she was 'bad with technology' and getting frustrated every time she tried to navigate it.\n\nInstead of just walking her through the steps again, I sat down and asked her about how she organizes things at home. She told me she's really good at organizing her house - everything has a place, and she always knows where to find things. Her kids always come to her when they can't find something.\n\nSo I reframed the LMS as being like organizing a house. I said 'Think of each subject as a different room. Just like you have a kitchen for cooking and a bedroom for sleeping, each subject has its own space with everything you need for that class.' I showed her how the discussion forums were like the living room where everyone gathers to talk, and the assignment submissions were like a filing cabinet where you put important documents.\n\nSudenly, it all clicked for her. She wasn't bad with technology - she just needed a framework that made sense to her world. Now she's one of the most active students on the platform and even helps other students navigate it.\n\nThat experience taught me that when someone doesn't understand a concept, it's usually not because they're incapable. It's because I haven't found the right way to connect it to something they already know. Now, whenever I'm helping someone, I always start by asking about their existing knowledge and experiences, then build bridges from there."

                                                                          "answer":  "I\u0027d be happy to! I got hands-on experience with RAG systems through my Food RAG Explorer project during my AI Builder internship.\n\nSo RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and the concept is really powerful. Instead of just relying on an AI model\u0027s trained knowledge, you combine it with a retrieval system that pulls relevant information from your own data sources. This makes responses more accurate and grounded in your specific data.\n\nIn my Food RAG Explorer project, I had structured data about 105 different food items stored in a JSON file. Here\u0027s how I implemented the RAG system:\n\nFirst, I created vector embeddings of all the food information. Think of embeddings as numerical representations that capture the meaning and context of the text. When a user asks a question like \u0027What are good protein sources from India?\u0027, their query also gets converted to an embedding.\n\nThen, the system performs a similarity search in the vector database - in my case, I migrated from ChromaDB locally to Upstash for production. It finds the most relevant food items based on how similar their embeddings are to the query.\n\nFinally, those relevant food items get passed to the AI model (I used Grok API) as context, and the model generates a response that\u0027s grounded in my actual data rather than just general knowledge.\n\nThe key advantage is accuracy and specificity. Instead of the AI potentially making up information about foods, it\u0027s pulling from my verified dataset and using that as the foundation for its responses.\n\nWhat I learned is that the quality of your embeddings and your retrieval strategy really matter. I also set up MCP servers to handle the communication between the different components - the vector database, the retrieval system, and the language model.\n\nThis experience gave me a solid foundation in how modern AI applications work, and I\u0027m excited to apply these concepts to more complex problems."

                                                                          "answer":  "Absolutely! My full-stack experience comes primarily from my 10-week intensive internship with ausbiz Consulting, plus my ongoing personal projects.\n\nOn the frontend, I work with React 19 and Next.js 15. What I really like about Next.js is the flexibility it gives you - you can do server-side rendering for better SEO and performance, or client-side rendering when you need dynamic interactions. I use Tailwind CSS for styling, which I love because it keeps everything consistent and makes responsive design much faster. I also use Shadcn UI for component libraries.\n\nFor state management, I\u0027m comfortable with React Hooks - useState for simple state, useEffect for side effects, and useContext when I need to share state across components.\n\nOn the backend, I build APIs using Next.js App Router, which lets you create type-safe APIs really efficiently. I work with Node.js and TypeScript, and I\u0027ve implemented RESTful APIs. I\u0027ve also worked with authentication using Auth.js, which handles things like session management and OAuth.\n\nFor databases, I use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Prisma is fantastic because it gives you type safety all the way from your database to your frontend, and migrations are really straightforward. I\u0027ve also worked with vector databases like Upstash for AI applications.\n\nOn the deployment side, I\u0027ve deployed all my applications to Vercel, which is incredibly smooth for Next.js applications. I\u0027m familiar with setting up environment variables, managing secrets, and optimizing for production. Vercel\u0027s integration with GitHub makes the CI/CD process seamless - every push triggers a new deployment automatically.\n\nI\u0027ve also integrated GenAI features using various LLM APIs, which has been really exciting to work with.\n\nWhat I appreciate about modern full-stack development is how integrated everything is. TypeScript gives you type safety across the entire stack, and tools like Prisma make the connection between backend and database really clean. It\u0027s all about building things that are not just functional, but maintainable and scalable too."

                                                                          "answer":  "Great question! I\u0027ve deployed all my applications to Vercel, so I can walk you through my approach.\n\nFirst, I start with planning and environment setup. I make sure I understand what services I\u0027ll need. For a typical full-stack app, that\u0027s usually hosting for the frontend/backend, a database, and maybe additional services like authentication or AI APIs. I think about different environments - development, staging, and production - so I can test changes before they go live.\n\nFor Vercel deployments, the process is really streamlined:\n\n1. I connect my GitHub repository to Vercel through their dashboard\n2. Vercel automatically detects it\u0027s a Next.js app and handles the build configuration\n3. I configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard for things like database connection strings and API keys\n4. Every push to my main branch triggers a new deployment automatically\n5. Vercel also creates preview deployments for pull requests, which is fantastic for testing features before merging\n\nFor my Food RAG Explorer project specifically, I also had to configure:\n- Integration with Upstash for the vector database\n- API keys for Grok API\n- Environment variables for the MCP server configuration\n\nThe key things I always make sure to do:\n- Security: Never commit API keys or secrets - always use environment variables\n- Testing: Test thoroughly in development before deploying to production\n- Monitoring: Check the deployment logs and function logs in Vercel dashboard to catch any errors\n- Optimization: Ensure images are optimized, implement caching strategies where appropriate\n\nOne thing I learned from my Food RAG Explorer project is the importance of choosing the right services for production. I migrated from local tools (Ollama, ChromaDB) to cloud-based services (Grok API, Upstash) specifically because they\u0027re built for production scale and reliability.\n\nVercel has made deployment incredibly smooth for me - the Git integration means I can focus on building features rather than managing deployment infrastructure. I\u0027m comfortable with the deployment workflow and understand the fundamentals of making applications production-ready."

                                                                          "answer":  "I\u0027ve had some really exciting hands-on experience with AI/ML integration, particularly through my internships with ausbiz Consulting.\n\nDuring my AI Builder internship, which I\u0027m currently completing, I\u0027m working on enterprise-grade digital twin implementations. This involves creating AI systems that can represent real-world entities and processes. The core of this work is using advanced AI architectures, vector embeddings, and RAG systems to make these digital twins intelligent and responsive.\n\nFor my Food RAG Explorer project, I integrated multiple AI components:\n- Started with Ollama running locally for development, which gave me a good understanding of how LLMs work\n- Migrated to Grok API for production deployment, which required understanding API integration, rate limiting, and error handling\n- Implemented vector embeddings to convert food information into numerical representations\n- Set up a vector database (moved from ChromaDB to Upstash) to store and retrieve these embeddings efficiently\n- Created the RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant information and augments the AI\u0027s responses\n\nDuring my Full Stack internship, I also worked with various AI integrations, learning about different model options and when to use each one.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve learned is that AI integration is about more than just calling an API. It\u0027s about:\n1. Understanding the problem: What\u0027s the best AI approach for this specific use case?\n2. Data preparation: Making sure your data is in the right format for the model\n3. Prompt engineering: Crafting effective prompts to get quality responses\n4. Error handling: AI responses can be unpredictable, so you need good fallbacks\n5. User experience: How do you present AI outputs in a way that\u0027s helpful and trustworthy?\n\nI\u0027m really excited about this field because it\u0027s moving so fast. I make sure to stay current by using tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude Desktop in my development workflow, which has also taught me a lot about how to work effectively with AI assistants.\n\nI\u0027m still early in my AI/ML journey, but I\u0027ve built a solid foundation and I\u0027m eager to learn more, especially around production AI systems and responsible AI practices."

                                                                            "answer":  "I actually did this recently with my Food RAG Explorer, so I can give you a real example!\n\nThe first step is assessment and planning. I mapped out what I had locally: Ollama for AI inference, ChromaDB for vector storage, local file storage for my food data, everything running on my machine. Then I identified what I needed for cloud deployment: a hosted AI API that\u0027s reliable and scalable, a cloud vector database, a web hosting service, and version control.\n\nNext comes choosing the right services. I researched options and chose: Grok API instead of Ollama because it\u0027s production-ready, Upstash instead of ChromaDB because it\u0027s a managed vector database service, Vercel for hosting because it\u0027s optimized for Next.js, and GitHub for version control.\n\nThen I did incremental migration:\n1. Started by migrating the vector database first - I exported my embeddings from ChromaDB and imported them into Upstash\n2. Updated my code to work with the Grok API instead of Ollama, which meant changing authentication, API calls, and response handling\n3. Built the web interface using V0.dev so users could actually interact with the system\n4. Tested everything thoroughly in development mode before deploying\n\nThe deployment was actually the easiest part because Vercel makes it so smooth - I connected my GitHub repo, configured environment variables for API keys, and it handled the rest.\n\nFinally, post-deployment monitoring - I tested it live, checked error logs, and made sure the API calls were working correctly and efficiently.\n\nWhat I learned from this experience: Don\u0027t try to migrate everything at once - do it in phases, test each component individually before integrating, always have your environment variables configured properly, choose managed services when possible, and document what you\u0027re doing so you can troubleshoot issues."
                                                                        },
                                                                        {

                                                                            "answer":  "This is something I deal with regularly as a tutor, and I\u0027ve developed a pretty effective approach based on working with over 100 students.\n\nFirst, I assess their understanding. I\u0027ll ask them to explain what they understand so far, which helps me identify exactly where the confusion is. Often, it\u0027s not the entire concept - it\u0027s one specific part that\u0027s creating a blocker.\n\nThen I break it down into smaller pieces. Complex concepts become much more manageable when you chunk them. For example, if a student is struggling with how APIs work, I won\u0027t explain the entire REST architecture at once. I\u0027ll start with: \u0027An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You tell the waiter what you want, they go to the kitchen (the server), and bring back your food (the data).\u0027\n\nI use multiple explanation styles because everyone learns differently: Visual learners get diagrams or flowcharts, hands-on learners code together with me and experiment, conceptual learners get analogies and real-world examples.\n\nI also provide tips and tricks that make concepts sticky. For example, when students are confused about GET vs POST requests, I tell them \u0027GET is like asking a question, POST is like submitting a form.\u0027 Simple mnemonics like this help them remember.\n\nAnother key thing is teaching problem-solving strategies, not just solutions. If someone comes to me with a bug, I won\u0027t just fix it - I\u0027ll walk them through my debugging process: Read the error message carefully, check the most recent changes, use console.log to see what\u0027s happening, break the problem into smaller parts, search for solutions systematically.\n\nI also make sure to encourage and validate their progress. Learning tech is hard, and people often feel discouraged. I remind them that everyone struggles with these concepts at first, and that asking for help is a sign of good judgment, not weakness.\n\nFinally, I follow up. After helping a student, I\u0027ll check in later: \u0027Did that explanation make sense? Do you need me to go over anything again?\u0027 This creates a safe environment where they feel comfortable asking more questions."

I\u0027ve developed a multi-faceted approach.\n\nStructured learning programs: I actively seek out intensive training. My two internships with ausbiz Consulting - the 10-week Full Stack Developer program and the AI Builder program - are perfect examples. These programs expose me to cutting-edge technologies in a structured way.\n\nAI-assisted learning: I use tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude Desktop not just for coding, but for learning. If I encounter a new concept, I\u0027ll ask specific questions and then implement what I learn immediately. It\u0027s like having a tutor available 24/7.\n\nBuilding projects: I\u0027m a strong believer in learning by doing. My Food RAG Explorer project, for example, forced me to learn about vector embeddings, MCP servers, and cloud deployment because I needed those technologies to build what I envisioned. When you have a real project, the learning becomes focused and practical.\n\nFollowing industry trends: I stay updated by following tech leaders and companies on LinkedIn, reading documentation for frameworks I use (React, Next.js, Vercel), and exploring new tools when they gain traction.\n\nCommunity engagement: As a student mentor, I\u0027m constantly discussing tech with students and other tutors, which exposes me to different perspectives and questions I haven\u0027t considered.\n\nPractical experimentation: When I hear about a new technology, I don\u0027t just read about it - I spin up a small test project. For example, when I learned about server-side rendering in Next.js, I built a simple app that used it, broke it intentionally, and fixed it. That hands-on experimentation makes concepts stick.\n\nCertifications and courses: I\u0027ve completed certifications like the Full Stack Developer credential, and I\u0027m always looking for my next learning opportunity.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve realized is that it\u0027s impossible to learn everything, so I focus on: Depth in technologies I use regularly (React, Next.js, Python), Breadth in understanding concepts (cloud architecture, AI/ML patterns), and Curiosity about emerging technologies (keeping an eye on what\u0027s coming).\n\nThe tech industry rewards continuous learning, and honestly, that\u0027s what makes it exciting to me. There\u0027s always something new to explore and master."

So I reframed the LMS like organizing a house: each subject is a different room, discussion forums are like the living room where everyone gathers, assignments are like a filing cabinet.

Instead of just showing her the steps again, I asked her how she organizes things at home. She lit up talking about how she organizes her house - everything has a place, her kids always know to ask her when they can't find something. So I reframed the LMS like organizing a house: each subject is a different room, discussion forums are like the living room where everyone gathers, assignments are like a filing cabinet. Suddenly it all clicked for her. She wasn't bad with technology - she just needed a framework that connected to her world. Now she's one of the most active students and even helps others navigate the system.",

He wanted to give her the working code to study; I thought we should work through the problem step by step. Instead of arguing about whose approach was better, I suggested we ask the student what would help her most. Turns out she learned best by seeing the final working version first, then breaking it down. The other tutor was right for this particular student. It taught me that technical disagreements are usually about different perspectives on the same goal, not right vs wrong approaches.",

The local setup with Ollama and ChromaDB worked perfectly on my machine, but the cloud migration was a disaster. The vector database connections failed, the API calls timed out, and I had no proper error handling. I was frustrated because I thought it would be straightforward. But breaking it down step by step - migrate the database first, then the API, then add monitoring - taught me that complex migrations need systematic approaches. The failure actually made the final working version much more robust because I had to think through all the edge cases.",

Other days, I'm barely keeping up. The real skill isn't perfect time management - it's communication and flexibility. When students need extra help during exam periods, I adjust my internship schedule. When I have a big project deadline, I communicate that to my mentoring supervisor. And honestly, each role makes me better at the others. Explaining technical concepts to students improves my communication skills for client work.
