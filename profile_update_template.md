üöÄ Just Deployed My AI Food Info Web App on Vercel!

Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been exploring how to move AI experiments from local setups to scalable web apps ‚Äî and I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project: an AI Food Information Agent üçΩÔ∏è

üß† What it does:
This AI agent provides insights about 105 different food items based on country and dietary preferences.
All data is stored in a structured foods.json file, and the app intelligently retrieves and responds using AI queries.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Tools:

Python ‚Äî main development language

Ollama (local) ‚Üí transitioned to Grok API for hosted AI inference

ChromaDB (local) ‚Üí migrated to Upstash for vector storage

V0.dev ‚Äî used to design and build the web interface

Vercel ‚Äî for hosting and deployment

GitHub ‚Äî for version control

VS Code Insiders + GitHub Copilot ‚Äî to speed up coding and prompt iteration

üí° What I Learned:
This project helped me deeply understand:

How RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems combine embeddings with contextual data retrieval

Vector embeddings and how they improve AI response accuracy

Setting up and integrating MCP servers for model communication

Migrating from local setups (Ollama + ChromaDB) to cloud-based AI architectures (Grok + Upstash)

Full deployment pipeline ‚Äî from local dev ‚Üí v0.dev ‚Üí Vercel
